## Overview

### The challenge

- Load the page https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/women/shoes/sneakers into your browser.
(This page is made up of thumbnails of articles that you can browse by scrolling down the page.)
- The aim of the exercise is to write a Javascript code snippet (in native JS if possible).
1) Once copied/pasted into the console, after the page has loaded, this snippet should display in the console the name and price of the items displayed, and only these.
2) If the user scrolls down the page, either with the mouse or the side navigation bar, the code should automatically push into the console the information for the new products displayed.
3) If the user re-displays products already pushed into the console, no information should be returned.

# scraping-app-test
A snippet JS to scrap some data.

Instructions : 

- Load the page https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/women/shoes/sneakers into your browser.
(This page is made up of thumbnails of articles that you can browse by scrolling down the page.)
- The aim of the exercise is to write a Javascript code snippet (in native JS if possible).
- 1) Once copied/pasted into the console, after the page has loaded, this snippet should display in the console the name and price of the items displayed, and only these.
- 2) If the user scrolls down the page, either with the mouse or the side navigation bar, the code should automatically push into the console the information for the new products displayed.
- 3) If the user re-displays products already pushed into the console, no information should be returned.
